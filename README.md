"index.html" is code that wa previously not accessible.
I've added semantic tags to the html, "alt" tags to images, cleaned up the code and adjusted the structure to try to comply with accessibility standards

## Acceptance Criteria


GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
<!-- WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements -->

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

<!-- WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes -->

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

<!-- WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title -->
